                    <p>map: Transforms each element of an array to a new value.map() returns a new array with the transformed elements.It returns a new array with the same length as the original array, but with each element transformed by the function.

                    forEach:  .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns
                        undefined.It does not return anything and does not create a new array.<br>

find: Returns the first element that passes a condition.It stops searching the array after finding the first match.<br>

filter: Returns a new array with elements that pass a condition.It returns a new array that includes only the elements for which the function returns true.

                <div class="px-4 pb-4">
                    <p>Local storage: Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.Data stored in local storage will persist even after the browser is closed, and can be accessed by any page on the same
                    domain.<br>
                    Session storage: It is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications.only accessible for the duration of the current browser session. When the browser is closed, session storage data is
                    deleted. Like local storage, session storage can be accessed by any page on the same domain. <br>
                Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for a long time, such as session IDs.They are commonly used for storing user preferences, login information, and other small amounts of data.</p>

                </summary>
                <div class="px-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
                    <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
                    Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
                    an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
                    <p>Call stack holds all the synchronous function calls. Call stack will execute code in a last in first out approach. So
                    last the most inner nested code will be executed first and then one level above that and so on. If the function call is
                    asynchronous it will add a new call entry on WebAPIs and the API will add a new call to the callback queue after the
                    asynchronous action is done.<br>
                When an event is triggered, it is added to a queue of events to be processed.
                
                The JavaScript engine checks to see if there is any code waiting to be executed in the call stack. If the call stack is
                empty, the next event in the queue is processed.

                </summary>
                <div class="px-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
                    <p>This quizTimer function, that takes a parameter which is  dismiss.
                    If dismiss is false, then function sets an interval timer using setInterval().After that timer is set to run a function that
                    updates a timer displayed on a webpage every second. 
                    The timer gives in a minutes and seconds.
                    The function calculates the number of minutes and seconds left by dividing the current count by 60 and using the
                    remainder. It then formats the time as a string and displays it in an HTML element with the id of count.
                    <br>
                    The function also changes the text color of the timer to red every 60 seconds, alternating between two shades of red.
                If dismiss is true, then the function clears an interval  timer using clearInterval(timer) and then returns it.
                This is a way to stop the timer.
